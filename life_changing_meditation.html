                    <h4>Are there different types of meditation?</h4>
                    <p>There are many forms of meditations, some different types of meditation are 
                    mantra meditation, mindful meditation, movement meditation, loving kindness meditation,
                    and visualization meditation.</p>

                    <h4>Mantra meditation</h4>
                    <p>
                        In performing Mantra meditation, the object of focus
                        for producing a relaxation response is a repeated word or phrase called a mantra.
                        You may choose any word for your mantra, and your only task is to repeat the mantra either
                        verbally or nonverbally in your mind. The purpose of this is to set your attention on repeating
                        this word or phrase and when your mind wanders you gently return it back to your mantra.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mindful meditation</h4>
                    <p>
                        In mindful meditation you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind.
                        You don't judge your thoughts or become involved with them you just simply ovserve them.
                        Often when doing mindful meditation you have a singular focus which can be the breathe, 
                        the feeling of your body touching the surface underneath you, or any other bodily sensation.
                        This practice combines awareness and concentration. As you steadily observe your object of focus
                        your mind may wander or you may have a bodily sensation or feeling, simply note it and return
                        back to your object of focus.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Movement meditation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most people think movement meditation is exclusively yoga, however this is not the case.
                        There are many forms of movement meditation such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>walking</li>
                        <li>tai chi</li>
                        <li>yoga</li>
                        <li>gardening</li>
                        <li>qi gong</li>
                        <li>any other gentle forms of movement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The focus of movement meditation is to be focused on whatever movement or task you are doing
                        with as much attention as possible. If your mind wanders you gently bring it back to the task
                        at hand.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Loving kindness meditation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This form of meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion, acceptance and kindness
                        toward oneself and others.
                        Usually this meditation involves thinking about loved ones, friends, acquaintances and all living beings and 
                        sending them well wishes.
                        This meditation is ideal if you hold feelings of anger or resentment that you want to overcome.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Visualization meditation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This form of meditation can help enhance feelings of relaxation,
                        peace and calmness by visualizaing positive scenes, images or figures.

                        When you do this visualization you idealy want to engage all five senses and
                        create as vivid of an image as possible.

                        Another form of this meditation would be to visualize yourself achieving a goal
                        that you are trying to achieve, which is intended to increase motivation and focus
