            It should be apparent, that i altered the code by removing the onclick function.
            Instead of using this method i decided to use event handlers (which are in scripts/script.js).
            This was to allow for mobile interaction as html onclick seemed to have issues handling that.

            <h2>John-Marco Tasillo</h2>
            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <h3>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose
                to implement?</h3>
            <p>
                The story behind my website is to display a vast amount of information for the reader of my news article
                to dive into.
                This includes great quotes, exceptional books, information on meditation, and some information on the
                philosophy of stoicism.
                The main purpose of the website is to provide high quality, useful knowledge to whomever decides to read
                the article.
            </p>
            <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
            <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers,
                websites, artists, blogs).</h3>
            <!-- I often, in this document sort my answers in lists as it is easier to read.
                Theres not much more to explain in this document, all i do is answer the questions stated. -->
            <ol class="report-list">
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    Ryan Holiday's books on stoicism inspired me to create this newsletter website for helping anyone
                    become
                    a better individual. You can find more information
                    <a class="report-link" href="https://dailystoic.com/">here.</a>
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    Usnews.com inspired my style for my books portion of the website. You can find more information
                    <a class="report-link" href="https://www.usnews.com/topics/subjects/meditation">here.</a>
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    Walmart.ca inspired the number highlighting feature at the bottom of the book page. You can find
                    more information
                    <a class="report-link" href="https://www.walmart.ca/en">here.</a>
                </li>
            </ol>



            <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
            <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>

            <ol class="report-list">
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    All the images in my website have alt's. This is in place to help users who are blind perhaps, and
                    are using a screen reader.
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    The contrast on the website is easy for anyone to read, whether that be in sunlight or for clients
                    who have impaired vision. The website is almost entirely black and white to meet this requirement.
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    The entire website can be navigated with tab (to choose what to click), enter (to click whats in
                    focus), and arrow keys/spacebar to scroll down the content.
                    Most of this was done by default html behaviour however, when you are in the mobile version of the
                    website, the dropdown menu required special code to be activated by
                    the enter key.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In summmary, my website should be fully accessible for clients using a screen reader,
                clients on a mobile device, clients with or without a mouse, and even clients who
                are using a mobile device and a screenreader at the same time.
            </p>

            <h2>Usability:</h2>
            <h3>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</h3>
            <ol class="report-list">
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    <p>
                        The website consists of many images, making it very visually appealing to the user, every
                        picture on one of the main pages can be clicked to the corresponding article.
                        Every title for every picture is also clickable, offering the client many ways to access each
                        article.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    <p>
                        Every link provides exceptional feedback to the user so they know that it is clickable content.
                        For example, the titles of each article when hovered changes to blue and underlines.
                        Another example is the images enlarge a bit when the user hovers them. This allows computer
                        users in too much or to little lighting to see exactly what they are accessing with even more
                        feedback.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    <p>
                        The webpages can be accessed via any device and will adapt accordingly. The client can also
                        resize the window to any size and the content will adjust accordingly
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Learning:</h2>
            <h3>State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that</h3>
            <ol class="report-list">
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    CSS:
                    The first thing that i learned very quickly was how to use flexbox and flex-wrap. This allows
                    content to work very well for the user on window resizes and when using different devices.
                    I also learned how to explicitly declare CSS changes with @media. I refined my previous CSS
                    knowledge which included basic styling with fonts, colors, and spacing using margin, padding,
                    and border.
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    JAVSCRIPT:
                    I had to learn advanced DOM manipulation.
                    I struggled to use mustache or handlebars, so i decided to create my own 'mustache' in
                    scripts/script.js. I learned how to extract information from the url, use that information to filter
                    javascript data, and output that data into html elements.
                    This allowed me to re-use the same base webpage for different articles. As a result, the website has
                    over 30 sub-articles which are all fully functional and more articles can be added very easily.
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    HTML:
                    I learned that the placing of your script tag is very important when you are using javascript code
                    that modifies lots of html elements. This was probably one of the biggest lessons i learned
                    in HTML, as it caused me to struggle for a while.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Evaluation I:</h2>
            <h3>What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful Why</h3>
            <ol class="report-list">
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    <p>
                        I believe the most successful thing in my website is the usage of my javascript to allow reusage
                        of webpages. This allowed me to add more articles very efficiently and saved a lot of time
                        coding
                        This also allows anyone looking in on my code to very easily add articles to the main pages once
                        they understand the javascript code. I also think the minor detail of the completion bar at the
                        top that
                        shows the client how far they've scrolled is very visually satisfying.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    <p>
                        Another thing i believe was successful was the highlighting on hovered titles and the image
                        enlarging on hovered images. I think this greatly enhances the usability of the website and
                        helps provide clients
                        with exceptional feedback for their actions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    Lastly, i believe the purpose of my website was met very successfully. The website is full of
                    amazing content for anyone looking on improving theirselves. From books to philosophy to quotes and
                    meditations the website
                    provides the client with various ways to better themselves.
                </li>

            <h2>Evaluation II:</h2>
            <h3>What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another
                time</h3>
            <ol class="report-list">
                <li class="report-list-item">
                    <p>
                        One thing that certainly could of been improved is my workflow. Although this isn't something
                        that you would of seen, i had to make many edits and spent far more time then i should of
                        working on this project.
                        I learned a lot in the process, however if I could do it over again I would set stricter
                        restrictions on myself as to what I am going to work on. I found without these restrictions I
                        would just do whatever i felt to
                        and this wasted a lot of time when i should of been writing more important code.
                    </p>

                Inspiration for the book page came from the first source below, whilst the second source inspired the
                highlighting numbers at the bottom of books.html.
                No code was copied, however i adapted the visual design in these websites to complement my own.

                And finally, all the pictures were free upon googling for them, except for the book pictures which i
                took myself of the books i own.
                The information for the book summaries were completely my own work. Each and every one of the books i
                listed were books i've read myself
                and therefore all the information from my summaries came directly from each book.
