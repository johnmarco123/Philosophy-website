                    <h1>What is Stoicism?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that was once one of the most popular civic
                        disciplines in the West, practiced by the rich and the impoverished, the
                        powerful and the struggling alike in the pursuit of the Good Life. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="main-body">
                    <h3>Why learn about stoicism?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever had a obstacle that made you feel overwhealmed, stressed or worried?
                        All of us experience obstacles and setback in life, but what matters the most is not
                        what happens to us, but how <b>we decide to respond to it.</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3>How do you apply stoicism to your daily life?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stoicism provides us a a practical guide to how to handle the stresses and hardships 
                        of life. Stoicism has 4 virtues in which everyone should live their lives
                        by to allow one to live a better life. To apply stoicism to your daily life you must first
                        understand the virtues in which you will practice. These virtues are:
                    </p>
                    <span id="courage"></span>
                    <ul id="styled-list">
                        <li><a href="#courage">Courage</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#temperance">Temperance</a></li>

                        <li><a href="#wisdom">Wisdom</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Courage</h3>
                    <p>
                        How do you deal with obstacles in your life? Do you pity yourself and distract yourself with meaningless
                        activities? Or do you bravely attack the challenges of life in a calm and direct manner? <b>Courage doesn't mean
                        you can't feel scared. Courage means that regardless of how you feel, you do whatever it is that you need to do.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scared of asking for your boss for a raise even though you have been going above and beyond for them? Is there a big
                        amount of work to do that you don't want to start? Did you lose all your money in stocks? All these problems revolve
                        around how you will respond right now. Will you view the situation with your boss as an opportunity to practice courage?
                        Will you courageously start and finish your work? Will you accept your lost money, shake it off and plan your next steps?
                    </p>
                    <span id="temperance"></span>
                    <p>
                        Every situation in life can be responded to with courage. This doesn't mean you respond without thinking. This leads us to our
                        next virtue of...
                    </p>
                    <h3>Temperance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although courage is very important, if the only virtue you practice is courage it can easily turn into recklessness.
                        Too little courage leads to behaving cowardly, whilst too much leads to acting without thought. Therefore what we need
                        is a way to balance between the two extremes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is what temperance is really about. It's about doing nothing in excess. Doing the right thing in the right amount in the right way
                        Anything in excess will ulitmately lead to pain. Eating desserts isn't bad, what is bad is when you eat them without self control. Spending
                        money on yourself is important, but if you don't balance your finances, you will soon be broke. Crying is an important human emotion, on one hand if
                        you cry every day your life will be very sad, on the other if you don't ever cry then you will not be able to express your sadness in a healthy manner.
                    </p>
                    <span id="justice"></span>
                    <p>
                        Everything must be balanced with careful consideration. Being courageous and possessing temperance are very important, however we must also ensure that
                        we conduct ourselves in a manner that is right. The virtue to keep in mind to achieve this is...
                    </p>
                    <h3>Justice</h3>
                    <p>
                        What is the meaning of life? Is it about money? Fame? posessions? Happiness? None of these things are really anything that truly matters in the end.
                        The only thing that matters is not what we have, but rather, how we act. Will we act justly in situations where acting unjustly presents a profit?
                        Sure, you can cheat your way through life, but how will that affect your life in the long run? How will it impact your soul? How will it influence
                        the world long after your gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no Stoic virtue that is more important than justice, because it influences all the others. In simple terms, without striving to act justly, none of
                        the other virtues are relevant or matter. Without aiming at a target does it really matter how well the archer shoots his arrow? In the same sense, if one
                        does not strive to act justly, none of the other virtues truly matter.  
                    </p>
                    <span id="wisdom"></span>
                    <p>
                        Doing the right thing is the compass we follow to do the right thing. How though, do we decide how we must act in any moment? What actually is the "right thing".
                        This leads us to our next virtue of...
                    </p>
                    <h3>Wisdom</h3>
                    <p>
                        All of the virtues thusfar have taught us to be courageous, to use temperance, and to act justly, but how do you decide how to do any of these?
                        This is where the virtue Wisdom comes in. The learning and knowing of the world. The experience that we require to navigate the world.
                    </p>
                       
                    <p>
                        The great stoic who invented stoicism, Zeno said "We have two ears and one mouth, so we should listen more than we say." We also have two eyes, 
                        therefore we should also read and observe much more then we speak as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to aquire information, yes, however it is vital that the information that you gain is good information. As the saying goes "garbage in garbage out".
                        If you read a book full of rubbish, all you will learn is rubbish. Whilst if you read a book with well formed thoughts, a good structure, and a core focus, this book
                        may change your entire life.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Application</h3>
                    <p>
                        So now what? You've learned the virtues but how do you apply them? The first step is humility. You must realize that no matter how much you know (or think you know)
                        there will always be someone who knows more. Therefore, you should be focused on being the best student you can be. That does not mean the best student in a classroom
                        setting, rather a student of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyone, and infact everyone is your teacher, and you can always learn from them. For example, your boss is frustrated and takes out his frustration onto you. Is this fair?
                        No of course it isn't, but that doesn't mean you should retaliate. You have the decision in that very moment to practice patience, kindness, compassion, humility, etc. You can 
                        respond to your boss kindly, you can do his tasks better then he asked for them to be done. This is not for a raise or a promotion, but rather it is for the betterment of your character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You always have the opportunity to learn from others, to act in a courageous, temperant, just, and wise manner.
