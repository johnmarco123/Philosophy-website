                    <h3>Book summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the most outstanding books there is on
                        the market for dealing with life's many challenges.
                        The book is based upon Stoicism,  the ancient Greek 
                        philosophy of enduring pain or adversity with perseverance
                        and resilience. Its primary focus is on three core areas,
                        perception, action and will. The book explains that when
                        you face an obstacle, if you view it as something that's
                        unfortunate and painful, it will be exactly that. As it
                        has been written in the bible “Ask, and it will be given
                        to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be 
                        opened to you.” (Matthew 7:7) and this book proves this 
                        very point. It shows you that obstacles are teachers that 
                        often teach you what you aren't currently looking to learn. 
                        The book also highlights that most obstacles that are 
                        challenging usually are excellent opportunities to practice 
                        your virtues.
