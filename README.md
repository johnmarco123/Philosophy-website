Welcome to my website, if you are looking to understand my code I would recommend doing it in this order...

1.) walk the website
2.) examine the HTML code (notice how there is practically no html code)
3.) see how my javascript injects the data into the DOM

If the script.js file looks a bit daunting because of its size, don't worry, it is fairly simple and i've commented how it works.

Please note, if your looking to validate my html code through a program you'll likely recieve many many errors. The only reason for this is because of the big amount of blank html tags i have. They all get filled, and they are all intentional, so do not fear.

Also note that this websites goal is to educate an individual on things they can do to improve themselves in all aspects of their life.
