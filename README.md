Welcome to my website, when looking through the code i recommend you look through the pages first and not the 
HTML source code. The reason for this is because i have very little HTML source code on the website. 

Nearly all of the website is being manipulated and modified using the scripts/script.js file. It is extensively commented
so it shouldn't be too difficult to grasp how it works.

PLEASE NOTE!
if you are validating my HTML using a program it will say my website is horendous. This is because i have many
blank tags that get filled by javascript. Please ensure you refer to the website directly as there is a ton of
DOM manipulation.
